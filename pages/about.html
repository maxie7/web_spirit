<h1>Wild Things Of Wyoming</h1>

<blockquote>
    Join an experienced naturalist on an unforgettable excursion into the wilds of Jackson Hole.   During one of our half-day or full-day safaris you will explore scenic locations while observing wildlife in their natural habitats.  In addition to wildlife watching, your naturalist guide will share the fascinating stories behind each species.  We record all wildlife sightings during our safaris as part of an ongoing “citizen science” project so each trip contributes to the understanding of our region’s wildlife.
